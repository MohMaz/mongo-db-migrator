# Assignment

Migrate a specific legacy JBoss Java application to a more modern platform according to the following directives:

The application you will be dealing with is the â€˜kitchensinkâ€™ JBoss application available in the Red Hat JBoss EAP Quickstarts GitHub repository (no need to analyse any of the other applications listed there)
The target stack to modernise this application is the latest stable version of Spring Boot or Quakus (your choice) based on Java 21 working with MongoDB, moving away from the Relational database.
Build a generic purpose tool that analyses a java application and creates a migration plan to make the code work with MongoDB.
The tool can use LLMâ€™s to analyse the codebase and build a migration plan
Stretch goal: The tool can also suggest a schema for MongoDB based on the static code scan. It would be great.
You can build this tool in any language of your preference.

Example:

Codebase: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic

Migration plan built by LLM for pet clinic repo: https://gist.github.com/mutukrish/7245a99f6c795cf79b6bb455db88789e

# Java Migration Tool

A CLI tool that uses LLMs to help migrate legacy Java Spring applications to Spring Boot + MongoDB.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Analyze Java codebase and extract structure
- Generate LLM-based migration plan to Spring Boot 3.x + MongoDB
- Optional MongoDB schema suggestion
- Markdown or JSON report output

---

## ðŸ“¦ Setup

1. Install Python dependencies using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
uv pip install -e .[dev]
pre-commit install
```

2. Install code2prompt CLI tool:

```bash
# Using Cargo (recommended)
cargo install code2prompt

# Or using Homebrew
brew install code2prompt
```

## Usage

```bash
# Using the static analyzer (default)
poe run --analyzer static

# Using code2prompt analyzer
poe run --analyzer code2prompt

# Generate MongoDB schema suggestions
poe run --schema

# Output in JSON format
poe run --output json
```

## TODO

- [ ] Clone repo if it does not exist
- [ ] use code2promp to curate prompt
- [ ] create a sandbox mongdb docker to run schemas against
- [ ] Add human in loop agentic pattern with memory
- [ ] Add UI for human in loop pattern
- [ ] Add ability to write the code! (Check SWE Bench)
- [ ] Enable code2prompt as MCP Server? https://code2prompt.dev/docs/how_to/install/#model-context-protocol-mcp
- [ ] Handle when repo is big and it doesn't fix model context
